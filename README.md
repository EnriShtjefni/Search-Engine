The goal of this exercise is to create a search engine index that contains a set of documents. Each document consists of a unique ID (file name) and a list of tokens (words). The search engine delivers results to queries by finding documents which contain certain tokens and returning their IDs (file name).
The application should accept a sequence of search words from standard input and respond on the results found as an output. The output contains the search terms entered, the file names they were found and number of hits. The results of each search are saved in a new file named 'results.txt'.
